}
```

Open `src/root.js` and paste your endpoint to the following line:

```js
const client = new ApolloClient({
  networkInterface: createNetworkInterface({ uri: 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__'}),
})
```

### 3. Run the example

You're done configuring the example application. Please run the following command. Have fun exploring! ðŸŽ‰

react-native run-android
```
